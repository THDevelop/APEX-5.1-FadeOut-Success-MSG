# APEX-5.1-FadeOut-Success-MSG
Hi together,
here you get the plugin for FadeOut the success MSG automaticly.
You can set your Display time by your choice.

Simple installation 
Import the Plugin make a Dynamic action on Page load
and add by true Auto Fade Success Message 5.1
Set your Display time by Milliseconds
its done.

UPDATE:
In some cases the DOM is explained differently why v01 does not work.
Unfortunately I can't tell you which version is installed on APEX, but I offer you 2 versions. It is best to install the v1 first and see if it works if it doesn't work just install v2.
